Ruby-TDD-Euler
--------------------
A series of challenging mathematical problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve test. Using [Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD) to check the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
### Run Instructions 

step 1: Create rspec-project-euler

step 2: create problem-1 folder inside the rspec-project-euler

step 3: Generate spec folder by typing

			rspec --init in the commmand line 
			
Step 4: Create a muliples_spec.rb to run the tests

		 ../problem-1/spec/muliples_spec.rb


step 4: Create a Lib folder and cretae a multiply_by? class

		../lib/mulipleNumbers.rb

Step 5: Run rspec in the terminal
	
		problem-1/rspec_hash_lab/rspec


		

Ruby-TDD-Calculator
--------------------

Ruby application developed using [Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD) to create a calculator. 
The application has multiple functionalities such as basic arithmetic with addition, substraction, multiplication and division operations; 

### Run Instructions 

step 1: Create rspec_calulator folder

step 2: Create lib and spec folders inside rspec_calculator


Step 3: Class Calcengine is found in

		 ../lib/calc.engine.rb

Step 4: Methods are found in

		 ../lib/calc.engine.rb
		 
Step 4: Tests are written in RSpec and include:


	 ../spec/calc_engine_spec.rb
	 
Step 5: Run Test in the terminal

Ruby-TDD-Arrays
--------------------
Knowldege check of data parsing syntax and tests developed using [Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD) to check that gven data pass the tests. 

### Run Instructions 

step 1: Create arrays folder

step 2: create rspec_hash_lab folder inside the arrays

step 2: Generate spec folder by typing

			rspec --init in the commmand line 
			
Step 3: Create a hash_spec.rb to run the tests

		 ../arrays/hashes/rspec_hash_lab/spec/hash_spec.rb

	 
Step 5: Run rspec in the terminal
	
	arrays/rspec_hash_lab/rspec
